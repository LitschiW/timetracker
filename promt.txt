Write a Desktop Application with a graphical User interface that can be used to track working hours.
It should have a small window that is always on top.
The Window should display 
- a Button that can start and stop a work time timer
- a Button to stop and start a secondary "pause"-tracking Timer 
- a button to reset the time
- the current total time and total pause time
The app should track the current session and save the state on pause or reset.
The app should also track and display the total weekly time(starting on and including Monday).

The app should be written in GO using a GUI library.
